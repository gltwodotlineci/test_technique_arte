## ARTE channel needs help.
1. They have a large **data table in csv format** and they need to make a study with these data. But there is a problem the data needs some transformation before the study. Can you help them by building some methods with python to bring the data in the right standard?

    * Your work will consist in transposing thee data for each month. *Be careful* they need a transpose mounth by mounth and not all the data at once
    * After the tansposing the data can you calculate the mean and the Variance for each channel by month and the general mean of each month?
